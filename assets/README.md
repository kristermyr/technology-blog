  ## Description
The Employee Tracker shows some of my newly learned skills working with node.js and MySQL2. I have learned an introduction in how you can build database properties with using the input of the user to create, update and view the database information. I spent a long time working on this app and I ended up not getting as far as i hoped. The create role function does not function as intented.
