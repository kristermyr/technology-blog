  ## Description
The Tech Blog shows some of my newly learned skills working with API routes, formhandlers, models and handlebars. I have learned an introduction in how you can build a full stack app. I spent a long time working on this app and I ended up not getting as far as i hoped. The delete and update function is currently not functioning.
